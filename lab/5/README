Implementation of Linear and Binary Search

Include the following:
1. Implement linear, sentinel and binary search. 
2. Search for any two data types.
3. Implement bubble and insertion sort before using binary search. Compute the total number of comparisons, data transfer operations for each sort.
4. Calculate the element comparisons, index comparisons for each search.
